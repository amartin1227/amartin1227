Hello and thank you for visiting my Github.

My name is Alejandro Martin V, but you can call me Alex. I am a Cal State University of Long Beach graduate with a BS in Computer Science. 
My passion is software development, mainly web development. I am proficient in Java, C++, Python, HTML, and Javascript. 

I want to further my knowledge in HTML and Javascript as that interests me the most. 

I hope you enjoy looking through my Github and my projects, both from school and free-time.
